This is very new to me. So far it's okay until my professor meant it and showed the class
Starting the assignment was a new step. I scan through the front page of his profile and didn't ask for more details of how to do it or where to turn it in
I learned that respositories is like another gateway opening without zipping the folder so that way everyone can view it without having to download the code. I didn't know that was possible until Mr. Thompson talked little bit about it in class.
Questions I might have with GitHub might be later in time, or earlier which ever one comes first.
What I like about this course is that change is okay and we're able to get to learn new outlets of submitting files another way to make life simple.
Additionally, I partially like this part of the course because:
      1. Another easy access to submit code (I like)
      2. Become hard to a new website that I'm not familiar of
I would like to see anything and I think this would be helpful in this learning journey of:
      1. Easy submission
      2. Being able to work together with classmates in group projects
      3. Also learn more about GitHub as well.
