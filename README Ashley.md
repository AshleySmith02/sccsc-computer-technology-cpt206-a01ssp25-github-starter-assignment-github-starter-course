Hello, my name is Ashley Smith and i am in Computer Programming/Database degree!
This is very new to me. So far it's okay until my professor mention it and showed the class on January 22nd.

Starting the assignment was a new step. I scan through the front page of the professor profile GitHub and didn't ask for more details of how to do it, where to turn it in, and if I needed to zip up my file (until it was too late).

However, over the weeked [Wednesday 22nd to this day] I learned that respositories is like another gateway opening without zipping the program folder so that way everyone, including classmates and the professor, can view it without having to download the code. I didn't know that was possible until Mr. Thompson gave the class a brief definition about it in class on Wedesday 22nd.

Questions I might have with GitHub might be later in time, or earlier which ever comes first of how to allow the teacher to see my work and also do code review of my other classmates code as an example.

What I like about this course is that change is okay and we're able to get to learn new outlets of submitting files another way to make life simple and easier.

Additionally, I partially like this part of the course because:
      1. Another easy access to submit code (I like)
      2. Become hard to a new website that I'm not familiar of.
      
I would like to see anything new and/or old and I think this would be helpful in this learning journey of:
      1. Easy assignment submission
      2. Being able to work with other classmates in group project of using GitHub
      3. Also learn more about GitHub at the same time.
